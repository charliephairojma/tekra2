Since you want to highlight upcoming events and include insider trading activity without using `requests` or `BeautifulSoup`, let's consider using a natural language processing (NLP) library like `spaCy`.

To find upcoming events, we can use a combination of NLP and web scraping. We'll start by collecting relevant articles from news websites that cover PDD Living. Then, we'll use spaCy to extract information about future events, such as earnings announcements or conferences.

For insider trading activity, we can utilize the `yfinance` library to retrieve historical stock price data and detect unusual trading patterns.

Here's a hypothetical example of how this could be implemented:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Retrieve PDD Living's stock history
stock_data = yf.Ticker("PDD")

# Use spaCy to extract upcoming events from news articles
from spacy import displacy
nlp = displacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
articles = get_news_articles_for_pdd(stock_data)
events = []
for article in articles:
    doc = nlp(article.text)
    for event in doc.ents:
        if event.label_ == 'DATE':
            events.append((event.text, event.start_char))

# Highlight upcoming events
print("Upcoming Events:")
for event in events:
    print(event[0])

# Include insider trading activity
insider_trading_activity = get_insider_trading_data(stock_data)
if insider_trading_activity is not None:
    print("Insider Trading Activity:", insider_trading_activity)
```

Please note that this example is highly hypothetical and requires significant modifications to work accurately. The actual implementation would involve more complex NLP techniques, data preprocessing, and web scraping.

Remember to always check the terms of service for any website or API you plan to use, and be respectful of the data providers' policies.

**Action 1: Search in a specific website**

```python
import yfinance as yf

stock_data = yf.Ticker("PDD")
search_results = search_in_website('https://www.sec.gov', stock_data)
print(search_results)
```

**Action 2: Read website content**

```python
from spacy import displacy
nlp = displacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
article = get_news_article_for_pdd(stock_data)
doc = nlp(article.text)
print(doc.text)
```

**Action 3: Read website content**

```python
import yfinance as yf

stock_data = yf.Ticker("PDD")
financial_page = read_website_content('https://investors.pdd-living.com/financials')
print(financial_page)
```
